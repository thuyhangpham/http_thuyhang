## Interactive Dashboard Built in Power BI

As part of this project, I designed and built multiple **interactive dashboards** using **Power BI** to support data-driven decisions in the **Purchasing Department** of ***Wide World Importers (WWI)***. Below are the main dashboards included in the solution:
### 1.  Purchase Invoices Dashboard
- **Purpose:** Provide a high-level overview of procurement performance and supplier spending.
- **Key Insight:**

  Total number of purchase documents and items ordered

  Total purchase amount and cost

  Spending distribution by product group and supplier
